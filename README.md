# Online-Voting-System
Welcome readers ...
To our Online Voting System, developed by using html , Css , javascript and fully working backend powered by php , MySql.

Introduction: 

At the end of any political term, millions of voters are called upon to cast their votes 
for their next political representatives. Unfortunately, many eligible voters will not be 
able to reach a polling station during the election.Some are living abroad or are 
deployed in the military. Some have disabilities and face inaccessible polling locations. 
Some simply don’t have the means to take the time to vote, whether it be due to a job, 
to travels, or to living far away from a voting center. 
You may hear an online voting system being referred to as an online election system, 
an online e voting system, or electronic voting. These all make reference to the same 
thing: a secure voting tool that allows your group to collect input from your group and 
closely scrutinize the results in real time. 


Overview: 

Online voting tools and online election voting systems help you make important 
decisions by gathering the input of your group in a way that’s systematic and 
verifiable.Oftentimes, these decisions are made on a yearly basis - during an event (e.g. 
your organization’s AGM) or at a particular time of the year. Or you might run 
ongoing polls amongst your group (e.g. anonymous employee feedback surveys). 
It’s a good idea to use an online voting system to: 

 Elect your leadership: A board of directors election is a good example, where there 
are multiple positions (e.g. chair, vice president, secretary, treasurer). All of which 
may include supporting documentation (e.g. biographies, resumes, head shots). 

 Admit new members to your group. This helps you stick to a regular, fair process 
of evaluation and lets candidates know what to expect. 

 Gather anonymous feedback from your employees. Managers (and managers of 
managers) want to know how their employees truly feel about their jobs and work 
life. Using an online voting system with a capacity for secret balloting helps 
employees express their true feelings, by understanding and trusting that their 
feedback will be heard, but not tied directly to them. 

 Vote on yearly budgets. And since adjustments to your budget are often needed, 
an online voting system will keep voting secure and accessible - no matter where 
the members of your group may happen to be. 

 Alter your operational procedures and bylaws. Just like leadership elections, 
expect group members to react strongly toward changes - no matter how minor - 
to organizational processes. You’ll want to collect individual responses to these 
changes in a systematic manner. 
In all of these cases, an online voting system will enable better decisions, justify those 
decisions, and let you share proof that these decisions were carried out in line with the 
standards of your group. 


How does our Website Work? 

 Registration/Login: 
To register to vote, voters are added to an electoral roll of eligible voters, as with any 
election. They are then provided with credentials, such as a username and password, 
to access the voting system.

 Voting 
Voters can cast a ballot by opening the election website from an Internet browser, 
identifying themselves (with their username and password, for example), and 
selecting their voting choices. Then all they need to do is click on the “cast” button. 
Correspondingly it’ll show us the message “VOTED” and all the other Vote Options 
will disappear which helps us to remove any discrepancies and inconsistency w.r.t the 
voting process. 

 Verification/Discrepancy Avoidance 
Verification is the last step, and it is usually optional, enabling voters to verify that 
their ballot was correctly registered by the voting system. 


What makes our Website unique?

1. Our Admin Panel 
An Admin will be able to perform all sorts of varied functions. For instance, An admin 
can create a particular election, he can add candidates to any particular election, he 
can delete an election when it’s over, he can delete the candidates who won’t be 
relevant to any current exixting election and most importantly he can also view the 
result of an election after its over. 

2. Our Backend 
How is it secure? 
In a world of hacking, threats and misinformation, one might think that voting over 
the Internet can be unreliable. However, online voting providers develop online voting 
systems so that they are easy for voters to use, yet extremely difficult for attackers to 
deceive.In an online voting election, votes can only be cast by eligible voters. They are 
then encrypted on the voter’s computer or smartphone, just after they are created, and 
are kept protected until they are counted. Also, no vote can be added, modified or 
removed from the ballot box in order to alter the final election result. In fact, a stateof-the-art online voting mechanism should offer higher security measures than 
regular paper voting, as well as any postal voting system. 

3. Accessibility and Reliability: 
Although voting alternatives exist for those who can’t fill out a standard ballot on 
election day, they are far from perfect. Postal voting methods leave little room for slow 
mail services and have no way for voters to verify that their ballot was correctly 
counted and not tampered with. Similarly, services for people with disabilities usually 
require them to forfeit their voter privacy by asking someone to vote on their behalf or 
telling a poll worker which option they would like to elect. 


Conclusion: 
Online Voting offers the benefits of these alternatives without any of the drawbacks. 
With online voting, every voter is guaranteed an accessible and secure voting method, 
their votes remain private and confidential, and they can participate in an election 
from anywhere, at any time. In a country like India, where amount of corruption 
outweighs the amount of times any fair election has been held, it’s absolutely worth 
making an online voting system which provides a safe space to anyone who wishes to 
vote and not worry about the consequences and see India move towards a brighter and 
corruption-free future.
